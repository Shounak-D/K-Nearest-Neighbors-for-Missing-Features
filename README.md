INSTRUCTIONS (for Demo run):

1. Load (in the MATLAB workspace) the required data with rows of the matrix 'x' corresponding to data-points and the row vector 'labels' of class-labels (see 'sampleWorkspace.mat' for an example).
2. Run 'KNNCode.m' with the relevant parameters.
3. The resulting predicted class labels can be found in the array 'yPred'.
